# 📄 **Pagination System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** 🌐

In this project, we will create a **Pagination System** that allows users to navigate through large sets of data, breaking it up into smaller, manageable chunks. This system will be created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Pagination is a common feature in many websites and web applications that helps in loading content in smaller portions instead of all at once.

## 📝 **Prerequisites**:

To follow along with this project, you should have a basic understanding of:

- **HTML** 📄 (for structuring the page and items)
- **CSS** 🎨 (for styling the page and pagination controls)
- **JavaScript** 💻 (for managing the logic behind the pagination)

You will also need:

- A text editor (e.g., **VSCode**) ✍️
- A web browser 🌐 to run the application

## 🚀 **Approach**:

### 1. **HTML Structure**:
- Create a basic structure for the pagination system using **HTML**. The structure will include:
  - A container for the items (e.g., a list or cards).
  - Pagination controls (e.g., Previous, Next, and page number buttons).
  
### 2. **CSS Styling**:
- Use **CSS** to style the pagination system and items:
  - Ensure the items are displayed in a clean, structured format.
  - Style the pagination buttons to enhance the user experience.
  - Highlight the active page button for better visibility.

### 3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
- Write **JavaScript** functions to manage the pagination logic:
  - **displayPage(page)**: This function will show the items for the current page.
  - **updatePagination()**: This function will update the pagination buttons based on the current page and total pages.
  
### 4. **Event Listeners**:
- Attach **event listeners** to the pagination buttons (Previous, Next, and page numbers) to allow seamless navigation between pages.

### 5. **Pagination Logic**:
  - Calculate the total number of pages based on the number of items and items per page.
  - Display the items corresponding to the current page.
  - Update the pagination controls to reflect the active page.

## 🌟 **Features**:

- **Dynamic Pagination**: Users can navigate between pages using the Previous and Next buttons or by directly selecting a page number.
  
- **Responsive**: The pagination system is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Active Page Highlighting**: The active page number is clearly visible to indicate the current page.
